# The Pursuit of Happiness: Insights from Global Data

## Introduction
In an exploration of global happiness metrics, a dataset titled **happiness.csv** was analyzed to delve deeper into the factors influencing happiness across various countries and years. This dataset encompasses key indicators such as the **Life Ladder**, **Log GDP per capita**, **Social support**, and more. By examining these elements, the goal was to uncover insights about what drives happiness on a national scale.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Country name**: The name of the country.
- **year**: The year of data collection.
- **Life Ladder**: A score reflecting well-being and happiness.
- **Log GDP per capita**: An economic measure indicating income per person.
- **Social support**: Indicates how individuals perceive social support in their lives.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth**: Average lifespan in good health.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Individual's sense of autonomy in life decisions.
- **Generosity**: Measured by donations and charitable actions.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: The publicâ€™s view on corruption within their country.
- **Positive affect**: Feelings of happiness or joy.
- **Negative affect**: Feelings of sadness or discomfort.

### Missing Values and Outliers
Significant attention was drawn to the missing values and outliers within the dataset:
- `Log GDP per capita`: 28 missing values, 1 outlier.
- `Social support`: 13 missing values, 32 outliers.
- `Healthy life expectancy at birth`: 63 missing values, 15 outliers.
- `Freedom to make life choices`: 36 missing values, 13 outliers.
- `Generosity`: 81 missing values, 39 outliers.
- `Perceptions of corruption`: 125 missing values, 184 outliers.
- `Positive affect`: 24 missing values, 6 outliers.
- `Negative affect`: 16 missing values, 28 outliers.

This data quality assessment hints at the complexities within happiness data, where both inconsistencies and extreme values warrant thorough investigation.

## Analysis and Insights
Upon conducting a correlation analysis, several noteworthy findings emerged:
- The mean value of the **Life Ladder** was approximately 5.48 with a standard deviation of 1.13, highlighting a degree of variability in happiness levels across nations. 
- A strong positive correlation between **Log GDP per capita** and **Life Ladder** emerged, suggesting that economic prosperity is a crucial determinant of happiness. Higher income per capita tends to correlate with higher happiness scores.
- Positive correlations were also observed between **Social support** and **Life Ladder**, indicating that strong social networks enhance well-being.
- Conversely, negative correlations were noted with **Perceptions of corruption** and **Negative affect**, revealing that high corruption levels tend to diminish happiness and increase feelings of sadness.

## Implications
The implications of these findings are profound. They highlight the intricate relationships between economic stability, social environments, and happiness levels. While enhancing GDP is a primary focus for many governments, the data suggests that fostering social support and addressing corruption could be equally important for improving the overall happiness of a nation's citizens.

Additionally, the high number of missing values and outliers, particularly in **Generosity** and **Perceptions of corruption**, signals a need for data cleansing and deeper investigation into these metrics. Further exploration could unearth significant trends that may inform public policies aimed at enhancing happiness and societal well-being.

## Conclusion
This analysis of **happiness.csv** paints a complex picture of what drives happiness across diverse cultures. It serves as a reminder that while economic factors play a vital role, the strength of social ties, the integrity of systems, and individual freedoms are equally significant in pursuing the elusive goal of happiness.
